LaTeX-Plus
=================

LaTeX-Plus is a multi-platform LaTeX plugin for Sublime Text 3. It works on OSX, Windows and Linux (Ubuntu).
LaTeX-Plus aims to be lightweight, extensible but self contained. If you are looking for a full feature plugin, see, for example [LaTeXing](http://latexing.com) or [LaTeXTools](https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools).
These two plugins are great. A lot of ideas are actually inspired by these two plugins. Unfortunately, LaTeXing is not open source and the development of LaTeXTools has been slowed down lately.

### ST2 compartibility
While it is possible to backward port to ST2,  I would rather keep it ST3 only for easier maintenance.
