LaTeXSq
=================

LaTeXSq is a multi-platform LaTeX plugin for Sublime Text 3. It works on OSX, Windows and Linux (Ubuntu).
LaTeXSq aims to be lightweight, extensible but self contained. If you are looking for a full feature plugin, visit

* [LaTeXing](http://latexing.com)
* [LaTeXTools](https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools)

These two plugins are great. A lot of ideas are actually inspired by these two plugins. Unfortunately, LaTeXing is not open source and the development of LaTeXTools has been slowed down lately.

### ST2 compartibility
While it is possible to backward port to ST2,  keeping it to be ST3 only would make it easier to be maintained.
